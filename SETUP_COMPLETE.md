### 🔧 Development Environment
- **Go modules** configured for each chaincode domain
- **Python virtual environment** with FastAPI dependencies
- **Docker Compose** configuration for local Fabric network
- **Testing frameworks** set up for both Go and Python

### ✅ Verified Components
- ✅ Go chaincode modules compile and test successfully
- ✅ Python FastAPI application starts and tests pass
- ✅ Project structure follows Domain-Driven Design principles
- ✅ All required dependencies are configured

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Docker (if not already installed)
# Then start the development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Set up Python Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Test the Setup
```bash
# Run Go tests
cd fabric-chaincode/shared && go test -v

# Run Python tests
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && pytest -v

# Start the API server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 4. Begin Implementation
The project is now ready for implementing the tasks defined in the specification:
- Open `.kiro/specs/blockchain-financial-platform/tasks.md`
- Start with task 2: "Implement shared chaincode libraries and utilities"

## API Endpoints (Ready for Implementation)

- `POST /api/v1/customers` - Create customer
- `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Get customer
- `PUT /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Update customer
- `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}/history` - Get customer history

### Loan Origination
- `GET /api/v1/loans` - List loan applications
- `POST /api/v1/loans` - Submit loan application
- `GET /api/v1/loans/{id}` - Get loan application
- `PUT /api/v1/loans/{id}/status` - Update loan status
