# Loan Origination Tests

This directory contains the cleaned up and organized test suite for the loan origination functionality.

## Test Files

### `test_loan_api.py` (32 tests)
Comprehensive unit tests for the main loan origination API endpoints:
- **TestLoanApplicationCreation**: Tests for loan application submission
- **TestLoanApplicationRetrieval**: Tests for retrieving loan applications
- **TestLoanStatusUpdate**: Tests for updating loan status
- **TestLoanApproval**: Tests for loan approval workflow
- **TestLoanRejection**: Tests for loan rejection workflow
- **TestLoanHistory**: Basic loan history retrieval tests
- **TestUtilityFunctions**: Tests for utility functions
- **TestValidation**: Tests for input validation
- **TestBusinessLogic**: Tests for business logic scenarios

### `test_loan_history.py` (19 tests)
Comprehensive tests for loan history and audit functionality:
- **TestLoanHistoryRetrieval**: Basic history retrieval tests
- **TestLoanHistoryPagination**: Pagination functionality tests
- **TestLoanHistoryFiltering**: History filtering tests
- **TestAuditReportGeneration**: Audit report generation tests
- **TestHistoryIntegrityVerification**: Blockchain integrity verification tests
- **TestDatabaseUtilities**: Database utility function tests
- **TestPaginationLogic**: Pagination calculation tests
- **TestAuditDataAggregation**: Audit data aggregation tests

## Cleanup Summary

The following redundant and unnecessary files were removed:
- `test_loan_api_comprehensive.py` - Integration-style test script (not proper pytest format)
- `test_loan_history_api.py` - Redundant history API tests
- `test_loan_history_core.py` - Redundant core history tests
- `test_loan_history_enhanced.py` - Redundant enhanced history tests

## Test Organization

Tests are now organized by functionality:
- **Main API operations** are in `test_loan_api.py`
- **History and audit features** are in `test_loan_history.py`
- Each test class focuses on a specific area of functionality
- Fixtures are shared appropriately to reduce duplication
- Mock objects are properly configured for isolated testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all loan tests
pytest backend/tests/test_loan_*.py

# Run main API tests only
pytest backend/tests/test_loan_api.py

# Run history tests only
pytest backend/tests/test_loan_history.py

# Run with coverage
pytest backend/tests/test_loan_*.py --cov=loan_origination
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ CRUD operations for loan applications
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Business logic workflows (approval/rejection)
- ✅ History tracking and audit trails
- ✅ Pagination and filtering
- ✅ Blockchain integrity verification
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ Edge cases and error scenarios
