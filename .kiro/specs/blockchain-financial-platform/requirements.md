# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a permissioned blockchain solution built on Hyperledger Fabric for legacy financial institutions. The platform leverages a Python/FastAPI data and API layer with Go chaincode to address critical pain points in financial operations. The solution focuses on three primary applications: Loan Origination, Customer Mastery, and Compliance & Regulatory Reporting, with the overarching goals of enhancing trust, increasing efficiency, improving compliance, and reducing operational costs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Loan Origination System

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want to manage loan applications through an immutable blockchain-based workflow, so that I can ensure data integrity, reduce processing time, and maintain a complete audit trail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authorized party submits a new loan application THEN the system SHALL record all initial data on the blockchain with cryptographic security
2. WHEN a loan application is submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically transition it through predefined stages (submitted, underwriting, credit approval, disbursement) using Go chaincode
3. WHEN any data point in a loan application is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain an immutable history of all changes including timestamp and user identity
4. WHEN a stakeholder requests access to loan data THEN the system SHALL enforce granular access control based on their authorization level
5. WHEN multiple entities work on the same loan application THEN the system SHALL provide a single, shared, verifiable source of truth eliminating manual reconciliation
6. WHEN an audit is requested THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive, tamper-proof audit trail of the entire loan origination process
7. WHEN legacy systems need to interact with loan data THEN the Python/FastAPI layer SHALL provide APIs for submission, retrieval, and updates

### Requirement 2: Customer Master Data Management

**User Story:** As a customer relationship manager, I want to maintain a single, immutable customer record across all systems, so that I can ensure data accuracy, comply with KYC/AML requirements, and manage customer consent effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authorized personnel create a new customer record THEN the system SHALL capture essential KYC/AML data and store it on the blockchain
2. WHEN customer data needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL record the changes while maintaining complete immutable history
3. WHEN a customer record is created or updated THEN the Go chaincode SHALL trigger identity verification checks with external providers
4. WHEN a customer record is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique blockchain-based identifier
5. WHEN customer consent is required THEN the system SHALL record and manage consent for data sharing linked to the immutable customer record
6. WHEN customer data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide versioning capability to retrieve any past version of the record
7. WHEN CRM or core banking systems need customer data THEN the Python/FastAPI layer SHALL provide APIs for querying and updating customer master data

### Requirement 3: Compliance and Regulatory Reporting

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automated regulatory rule enforcement and real-time reporting capabilities, so that I can ensure proactive compliance, reduce regulatory risk, and provide transparent access to regulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is processed THEN the Go chaincode SHALL automatically enforce regulatory rules (AML/KYC checks, transaction limits) before committing to the ledger
2. WHEN regulators need to monitor activities THEN the system SHALL provide a secure, read-only interface through the Python/FastAPI layer for real-time or near real-time access
3. WHEN regulatory reports are required THEN the system SHALL automatically generate predefined reports based on immutable transaction history
4. WHEN transactions or customer updates occur THEN the chaincode SHALL integrate with sanction list screening services
5. WHEN compliance checks are performed THEN the system SHALL record all checks, failures, and overrides on the blockchain as part of the immutable audit trail
6. WHEN compliance rules need updates THEN the system SHALL allow controlled updates to chaincode with proper versioning and approval processes
7. WHEN potential violations are detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts or notifications to compliance officers

### Requirement 4: Data Model and Actor Management

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want a comprehensive operational data model with proper actor management and access controls, so that I can ensure data integrity, traceability, and appropriate permissions across all system interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any actor interacts with the system THEN the system SHALL maintain a complete Actor registry with blockchain identity, role, and type information
2. WHEN customer data is managed THEN the system SHALL maintain a master Customer record with unique blockchain ID, KYC/AML status, and consent preferences
3. WHEN loan applications are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain LoanApplication entities with complete history tracking and document associations
4. WHEN any data changes occur THEN the system SHALL record immutable history with timestamp, actor identity, and transaction details
5. WHEN compliance rules are defined THEN the system SHALL maintain ComplianceRule entities with logic, domain applicability, and modification tracking
6. WHEN compliance events occur THEN the system SHALL record ComplianceEvent entities with rule references, affected entities, and acknowledgment status
7. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL maintain LoanDocument entities with cryptographic hashes and verification status
8. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL enforce referential integrity between Customer, LoanApplication, Actor, and Compliance entities

### Requirement 5: Data Warehousing and Analytics

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want a comprehensive data warehousing solution with dimensional modeling, so that I can perform historical analysis, generate regulatory reports, and monitor performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blockchain data needs analysis THEN the system SHALL extract data from Hyperledger Fabric ledger via the Python/FastAPI layer
2. WHEN data is transformed for analytics THEN the system SHALL implement dimensional modeling with fact and dimension tables
3. WHEN loan origination analysis is required THEN the system SHALL provide Fact_LoanApplication_Events with measures for duration, amounts, and approval status
4. WHEN compliance analysis is required THEN the system SHALL provide Fact_Compliance_Events with measures for violations, alerts, and acknowledgments
5. WHEN historical data changes THEN the system SHALL implement Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2 SCD) for maintaining historical accuracy
6. WHEN dimensions are shared across data marts THEN the system SHALL implement conformed dimensions for Customer, Actor, and Date
7. WHEN data warehouse is loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain data lineage and ensure consistency with blockchain source data
8. WHEN analytical queries are performed THEN the system SHALL support star schema queries for optimal performance

### Requirement 6: Platform Infrastructure and Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust, scalable blockchain infrastructure with secure API integration, so that I can ensure high availability, data security, and seamless integration with existing legacy systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform is deployed THEN it SHALL use Hyperledger Fabric as the permissioned blockchain infrastructure
2. WHEN data is stored or transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data both in transit and at rest
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the platform SHALL handle a projected 20% year-over-year increase in transaction volume
4. WHEN data is submitted to the blockchain THEN it SHALL adhere to predefined schema and validation rules enforced by Go chaincode
5. WHEN the API layer is accessed THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime availability
6. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption or hashing with proper access controls
7. WHEN compliance checks are executed THEN they SHALL not introduce significant latency into transaction processing
8. WHEN regulators or auditors need verification THEN they SHALL be able to independently verify the integrity and accuracy of all data and reports
